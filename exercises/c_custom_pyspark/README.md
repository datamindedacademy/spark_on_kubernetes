**Optional**

The goal of this exercise is to run your own Spark application on a custom
Docker container on the kubernetes cluster.

TASK
====

Create a simple PySpark application that shows the ten first natural numbers
(i.e. 0-9) and have this submitted to the Kubernetes cluster.

You can try to slim down the Docker image since the default is deploying 
many things you don't need. How small can you make the resulting Docker 
image?
