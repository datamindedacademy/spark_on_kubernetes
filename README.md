These are the exercises that go with the introductory course of Running Spark
jobs on Kubernetes. For in-depth Spark and Docker, we have different workshops.


# Get started

We use Gitpod to provide a working environment, in which you have all the
needed tools. Familiarity with the shell is a prerequisite. Additionally, do
not feel daunted by the sheer number of Kubernetes commands or flags that go
with a spark-submit: these are things you look up, don't memorize. Try to
understand the concepts, as these stick longer in memory.
