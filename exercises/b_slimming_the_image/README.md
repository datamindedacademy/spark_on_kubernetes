The goal of this exercise is to provide you with some options that could help
you in slimming the Docker image that you intend to submit.

TASK 1
======
Analyze the Dockerfile used in the creation of the image. What, if any, can be optimizedwhen you know the requirements of your Spark application?


TASK 2
======
Build a Docker image that adds the PySpark language binding (see $SPARK_HOME/kubernetes/dockerfiles/spark/bindings/python/Dockerfile ). Pay close attention to the output during this run. If you have some Python familiarity, spot the improvements.
